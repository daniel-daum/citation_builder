# citation_builder

A simple GUI to generate citations for my workplace. 

Problem: I work for an no name government organization. We generate hundreds of reports and analysis products daily. We are requried to cite every source we use on each of these, however, it can be very time consuming to hand type all of these sources. One written product may cite 40 sources as a low estimation.

Solution: Make a tool that generates these citations for us. For example, it would be much easier if we could  copy and paste the source information into a desktop GUI-type applciation and it will print out a properly formatted citation according to our internal standards. 

Minimum Viable Product Requirements: 

1) This application must be able to take source information as input and output a properly formatted citation (This citation format is an internal standard).
2) This application must be a desktop based GUI. For reasons, Web applications are not a viable solution.
