# citation_builder

A simple GUI to generate citations for my workplace. 

Problem: I work for an no name government organization. We generate hundreds of reports and analysis products daily. We are required to cite every source we use on each of these, however, it can be very time consuming to hand type all of these sources. One written product may cite 40 sources as a low estimation. We do not have access to the internet, and thus lack the ability to use already readily available online citation generators.

Solution: Make a tool that generates these citations for us. For example, it would be much easier if we could  copy and paste the source information into a desktop GUI-type application and it will print out a properly formatted citation according to our internal standards. 

Minimum Viable Product Requirements: 

1) This application must be able to take source information as input and output a properly formatted citation (This citation format is an internal standard).
2) This application must be a desktop based GUI. For reasons, Web applications are not a viable solution. 


Final note to others: This is my first ever coding project as a self taught individual. I am practicing my use of basic OOP principals and I am using git for the first time

EDIT: Data Findings. On average it takes about a minute plus or minus 10 seconds for a memeber in my workplace to generate a citation by hand, based on a sample of 10 people. 

On average it takes those same 10 people 30 seconds (plus or minus ~6 seconds) to generate a citaiton using this citation builder. This simple tool effectively cuts citation time in half for my workplace.
